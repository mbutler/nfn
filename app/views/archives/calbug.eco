<h4>Changes in California Dragonfly Communities over the Past Century</h4>

<p>At UC Berkeley, we are using Notes from Nature records to determine how Odonata species have responded to landscape alteration and climatic changes in California over time. We will compare lists of species by county and ecoregion, before and after 1960, using what is called “list-length analysis.” One major problem with using museum collection data in analyses of community change is variation in collecting effort over different regions and time periods. By using the length of the lists as a proxy for effort, we can help correct for this important bias in the data. Our goal is to determine changes in community metrics, like richness and similarity indices, and to identify species that are expanding or contracting in their distribution.</p>

<p>Data from these records will also provide the occurrence locations for distribution models of several species that have significantly expanded or contracted over the past century. These models use landscape data in the vicinity of species occurrence locations—such as land use, freshwater habitat, topography, and climate—to predict where a species may be found over the entire landscape. We can also project species likely distribution onto past landscape coverages (which are available starting in the 1970s) to examine changes in species distribution and to identify the landscape variables most associated with distribution change.</p>
